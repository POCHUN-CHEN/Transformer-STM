Image Recognition for Selective Laser Sintering SLS Image Recognition

SLS Image Recognition

# Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project that utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image recognition in the context of Selective Laser Sintering (SLS). SLS is a popular additive manufacturing process used in 3D printing, and this project aims to automate the identification of specific attributes or defects in SLS-produced parts through image analysis.

# Key Features
* Deep Learning with CNNs: The project leverages deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks, to analyze images of SLS-manufactured parts. CNNs are known for their effectiveness in image classification tasks.

* Flexible Framework: While currently implemented using a CNN, the project is designed to be adaptable. In the future, it can be extended to incorporate various machine learning algorithms for image recognition.

* Data Preprocessing: The code includes data preprocessing steps such as image resizing, grayscale conversion, and label extraction from an Excel dataset.

# Getting Started
1. Prerequisites: Ensure you have the required Python libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, NumPy, OpenCV) installed. You can find the dependencies in the requirements.txt file.

2. Data Preparation: Prepare your dataset of SLS images and corresponding labels. Organize them in a structured manner to facilitate training and testing.

3. Model Training: Train the CNN model using your dataset by running the training script.

4. Testing and Validation: Evaluate the model's performance using test data and validate its accuracy in identifying features or defects in SLS parts.

# Future Enhancements
This project is continuously evolving, and future enhancements may include:

* Incorporating different machine learning algorithms for comparison and improved accuracy.
* Expanding the dataset to handle a wider range of SLS part variations.
* Developing a user-friendly interface for easy deployment and usage.
